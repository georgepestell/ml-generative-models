# Machine Learning - Generative Models

An exploration into probabalistic generative models; the EM algorithm; and the impact of latent variables.

- Spherical K-Means
- The EM algortithm on handwriting digit samples
- Image generation using a MixBerns EM model

# Setup

Jupyter is required to run this, along with a series of dependencies in `requirements.txt`. A virtual environment may make setup easier:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Running

After setup is complete and dependencies are installed, run:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then select the `main.ipynb` file and run as desired.
